# Crop Disease Detection using Deep Learning

This project is a practical implementation of the research paper "Crop Disease Detection using Deep Learning," submitted for Deep Learning.

## Dataset

This project uses the public PlantVillage dataset, which can be downloaded here:

## How to Run

This project is designed to be run in Google Colab. The code is structured into sequential blocks:

1.  **Block 1:** Downloads the dataset using the `kagglehub` library.
2.  **Block 2:** Creates the `tf.data` pipelines for efficient, no-RAM-crash training (80:10:10 split).
3.  **Block 3:** Builds, trains, and evaluates the model.
4.  **Block 4:** Generates the final classification report and confusion matrix.

## Project Status & Results

This project successfully implements the methodology from the research paper. This involved solving significant technical challenges, including:
* Migrating from manual data loading to an efficient `tf.data` pipeline to prevent RAM crashes on the large 54,000+ image dataset.
* Implementing a two-step fine-tuning process (warm-up and fine-tuning) to achieve high accuracy.

### ResNet50 Experiment

The ResNet50 experiment was run successfully.

During a complete 30-epoch training session, the model achieved a **final test accuracy of 98.5%**. This confirmed the effectiveness of the fine-tuning strategy, with accuracy jumping from ~32% (frozen model) to over 98% (unfrozen model).

The code in this repository is the **exact, finalized code** that produced this 98.5% result.

### EfficientNet Experiment

The code for running the EfficientNet model is included in **Block 3** (commented out), demonstrating the complete methodology planned in the research paper.
